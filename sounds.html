          <h2>Music Style</h2>
            <p>Eric Barone developed everything about this game entirely on his own, and the music is no exception. Barone hand-crafted every single track in the game. This game's "indie game" style is reflected by the music, which is similar in style to the type you'd hear in a game made in the 1990s. Barone is able to adapt the music and produced sounds to all sorts of different areas in the game, including the beach and mine areas, as well as during crucial moments of the story and holidays.

          <h2>How Music and Sound is Used</h2>
            <p>The music and sound is used appropriately and to largely enhance your experience playing the game in some surprising ways. A great example of a beautiful track that is used wonderfully is during a summer holiday known as the "Moonlight Jellies". This is one of the simplest holidays in the game. The great thing about all holidays is that the entire town gathers in one spot so you can interact with everyone and further develop your relationships. While some holidays involve some sort of game or competition, this one is merely going down to the beach at night, and watching these glowing jellyfish swim around with beautiful views. The ambient track "Dance of the Moonlight Jellies" comes on during the cutscene and you are immediately immersed by how captivating such a simple cutscene is.
