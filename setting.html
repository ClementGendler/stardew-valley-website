          <h2>Days and Seasons</h2>
            <p>Days and seasons are the main forces that force the player to be efficient, make decisions regarding productivity, give the player gains and losses. But moreover, they drastically alter and create the foundation for the setting of the game. The way a day works is that you wake up at 6am every day, shops and establishments within the town open around 9-10am, you have a whole day to do whatever you need to do, and then you should be back and asleep by 12am at the latest. Staying up later will deplete a bit of your energy that you could otherwise use to farm. If you stay up too late and don't go to bed, you'll pass out, lose all your items, and a townsperson would have to bring you back to your farm. Seasons largely change the atmosphere and each have unique crops that you can only grow during specific seasons to add to your "community bundles". In the winter, however, unless you have a rare greenhouse, you cannot farm at all. Therefore, winter is a good time to explore in the mines or do a lot of fishing/socializing!

          <h2>What's Around Town?</h2>
            <p>Pelican Town is a thriving little farming village in which the player plays the entire game. Beyond the houses of all the residents, there are establishments like an artisinal shop to buy crops, a supermarket, a bar, a blacksmith's establishment, a museum, and even some freaky mines and sewers to explore! The town is quaint and tiny but rich with plenty of opportunities to discover new things and establish a nice life for your farmer. The town features a nice array of colorful trees, houses, and grass.
