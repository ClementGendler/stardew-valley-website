          <h2>Main Storyline</h2>
            <p>One of the odd beauties about this game is its minimalistic storyline that contributes directly to its ability to ease in a large variety of players. The farmer's grandfather, "grandpa", has some old farmland that you inherit. It's rustic and worn down, so you start from scratch to build up your farm. Indeed, at its core, that's as simple as it is. Players are often more captivated by the wide array of activities to engage in within the town, and also building up your small and worn down farm into something incredible. The main storyline's simplicity is a beautiful part of the game, as it enables you to engage in all sorts of side stories.

          <h2>Relationships and Quests</h2>
            <p>Developing relationships with the other townspeople is a large component of the game's story content. The closeness to each character is measured by "hearts". The more hearts you have with another character, the closer your relationship is. As you keep developing hearts, you start to encounter cutscenes with those characters around the town! Quests range from small side quests that consist of helping out townspeople with various errands, which gets you rewards and develops hearts with the questgiving character, to dedicated sidequest storylines from places like the adventurer's guild and the wizard's house!
