          <h2>Meet Eric Barone!</h2>
            <p>Eric Barone is the sole developer of Stardew Valley. After receiving a degree in Computer Science from his university, he began to work on Stardew Valley for around 4 years. This was not an easy process by any means, however, for more than just the amount of incredibly hard work Barone put into the game. Supporting himself as a theater usher, Barone had difficulty making ends meet while simultaneously putting the required amount of time in to develop the game. Unexpectedly, after finishing the game and publishing it, the reception was overwhelmingly positive. The game is cemented as one of the greatest games made in this decade.</p>

          <h2>What inspired Stardew Valley's Development?</h2>
            <p>Eric Barone loved playing a game called Harvest Moon, which is very similar to Stardew Valley. Both games are farming simulators and have similar town and community elements. However, there are quite a few notable differences between the two to the point where many people think that Stardew Valley is an improved version of Harvest Moon. Namely, Stardew Valley gives you more freedom in game, a longer and slightly more enriched story, more opportunities to bond with the main cast of characters, and generally easier-to-manage farms.</p>
