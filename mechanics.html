          <h2>Action and Movement</h2>
            <p>Stardew Valley has relatively simple mechanics when it comes to action and movement, which means it's very accessible to almost anyone: even people who have never played a video game before! There isn't much beyond moving around, using an action button to use any tools or items you have, or pressing a button to retrieve a crop. The game also features a wonderful mini-bar on the bottom of the screen to quick access the first 9 items from your inventory, much like minecraft. All of these mechanics mesh well together to make the ease of access and enjoyability very smooth!</p>

          <h2>The Inventory</h2>
            <p>The inventory is the main hub of keeping track of things that your character is achieving/needs to achieve, as well as managing your resources and organizing what you want to accomplish in a given day in-game. This game features skills to build off of like fishing, crafting, foraging, and farming. In addition, your inventory enables you to see your progress with building relationships with all the townsfolk, and it allows you to preview a map of the whole town.
